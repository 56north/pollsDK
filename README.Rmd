Welcome to `pollsDK`. 

You download the package by running:

`devtools::install_github(56north/pollsDK) #Install devtools first if needed`

After install you are ready to go. The package so far has three functions:

`gahner()` pulls polling data from Erik Gahners Github repository.

`berlingskebarometer()` pulls Berlingskes weighted average of polls.

`ritzauindex()` pulls Ritzaus weighted average of polls along with some individual polls.

It also has a short data file called `partycolors` containing the colors (as set by Berlingske) of the individual parties. 

Give it a spin. And please contribute to the code. Know of more sources for polls? Add them. Want to create an uber-cool visualization? Do it!
